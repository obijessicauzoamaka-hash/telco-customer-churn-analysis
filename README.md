# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end analysis of customer churn data from a telecommunications company. The objective is to understand customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and generate business insights that can help improve customer retention.
The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python.
This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills including data preprocessing, statistical exploration, and business-focused interpretation of results.

## Business Problem
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based companies. Losing customers leads to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.
This analysis identifies the characteristics of customers who are most likely to churn and highlights the key factors influencing customer retention.

## Key Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rates.
Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
Customers with longer tenure are less likely to leave.
Customers without long-term contracts demonstrate higher churn behavior.

## Business Recommendations
Encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts.
Offer retention incentives for customers with short tenure.
Review pricing strategies for high monthly charge customers.
Improve retention campaigns targeting high-risk customers.
